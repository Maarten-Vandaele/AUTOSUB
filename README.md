# AUTOSUB "UNDER CONSTRUCTION" 

## Idea

I get asked to spot subtitles on a regular basis.

I am working on an auto subtitling pipeline that can take in video and output a SRT subtitling file with timecodes. Eliminating the tedious work of spotting subtitles and reducing the time spent on that significantly.
